            <h3>What Gada stands for <i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-5x pull-right"></i></h3>
            <p>
                Technology has enabled patterns of organic collaboration, from <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" target="_blank">funding</a>
                to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">coding</a>,
                to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">knowledge-sharing</a>.
                We believe that the collective intelligence and creativity of people can be the most powerful force for social progress.
                no single individual, group or organisation can have better answers than the sum of us.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why we want to empower people to address the great challenges our communities and our planet face. The right to shape our collective future is ours: let’s reclaim it!

            <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
                A website (or an app) cannot change the world. People can. Our job is to help people work together and use their passion, drive and ideas to generate positive change.
                These are the tools we want to use:
            </p>
            <ol style="margin-bottom:24px;">
                <li>a platform where people can connect to each other and with the outside world: debate, build teams, find resources and gain visibility; </li>
                <li>a <a href="http://gada.org.uk/how-it-works" target="_blank">method</a> to harness ideas and turn them into policy change; </li>
                <li>a task force that supports ideas by facilitating team work, finding resources and building connections; </li>
                <li>a network of external partners sharing their expertise to increase the quality and efficacy of our policy work</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Be part of the community <i class="fa fa-users fa-5x pull-right"></i></h3>
            <p>
                Anyone can join Gada, for free. All you have to do is register and create a profile, which will take a few minutes. By doing that you will be able to receive personalised information and become active.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once in, you will be able to read news, share resources, brainstorm solutions to collective problems, post/read about events in your area,
                create/join teams working on a policy idea, give and ask for support to the community, publish and disseminate your policy ideas, organise actions and activities,
                connect with policy organisations and raise money to support your cause. As it grows, we hope Gada will take a life of its own and create things no one can anticipate.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a member of the community, you are free to participate as much as you want. Think about three archetypical members: you can be any (or all) of them at different times.
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>reader</strong>: checks the news, watches videos, reads the discussions and more generally consumes the content generated by the Gada community;</li>
                    <li>The <strong>thinker</strong>: joins and actively contributes to discussions and brainstorming sessions, shares relevant information, provides feedback and </li>
                    <li>The <strong>doer</strong>: starts or joins a team that develop ideas, and supports or leads campaigns to achieve social change.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Learning lessons <i class="fa fa-university fa-5x pull-right"></i></h3>
            <p>
                No one’s yet done what we want to do in quite the same way. So it’s only natural that this will be a learning process – for us to understand how we can best engage and help you,
                for you to understand how to engage, and for everybody to uncover and develop the potential of collective thinking and action.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the very first iteration, and a small part of, Gada’s prototype platform which will be used over the next 12 months to learn about your needs.
                These lessons will determine the shape of the platform (a website and an app) that will launch in late 2016. So please don’t be shy.
                You can start by filling in our 10-click snapshot <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10wcETCE2VIt-IHUFgWz1hF3VsrcZSfWwAYCTPkOh6fo/viewform" target="_blank">survey</a>
                and contribute to our ongoing discussion “crowdsourcing social change how do we make gada work?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, we will release updates, open new sections of the website, and gradually introduce new services and ideas - including those suggested by you.
